 *			When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be 
 *			included in the next commit.
 *			This command doesn't change the repository and the changes are not saved until we use git commit.
 * 
 * @example git add -A
 *
 * @notes 	To add everything at once: -A

/*
 * @command Commit
 *
 * @brief   This command record changes to the repository. 
 * 			This is maybe the most-used command of Git. 
 *			Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to save our changes.
 * 			Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.
 *			We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.
 *			
 * @example git commit -m "commit message"
 *
 * @notes 	This command saves your changes only locally.

 *
 * @notes 	This operation may cause conflicts that you need to solve manually.

/*
 * @command Push
 *
 * @brief   After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send
 *			your changes to the remote server. 
 *			This command uploads your commits to the remote repository.

 *
 * @notes 	This command only uploads changes that are committed.
