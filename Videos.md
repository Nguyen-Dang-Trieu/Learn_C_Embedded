- [aKaReZa 15 - Embedded_C, VSCode](https://youtu.be/pgIYUdyb7S8)  
  ---  
  In this video, learn how to install and configure VSCode and its required tools for programming various microcontrollers such as AVR, STM32, STM8, ESP8266, ESP32, and Arduino. You‚Äôll also learn how to compile code, generate the HEX output, and program the microcontroller. Additionally, we‚Äôll create a new Arduino project and explore how to install and use Arduino libraries in the PlatformIO environment.
