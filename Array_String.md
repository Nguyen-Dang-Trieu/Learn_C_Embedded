# 📚 Arrays, Strings, and String Handling in C

In C programming, **arrays**, **strings**, and **string handling** are fundamental concepts. Understanding how they work is crucial for effective programming, especially in low-level environments like microcontrollers.

## 🔹 **Arrays in C**

An **array** is a collection of elements of the **same type** that are stored in **contiguous memory locations**. Each element can be accessed using an index.

### 1. **Defining and Initializing Arrays**

To define an array, you must specify the type of its elements and the number of elements (or size) it will hold.

```c
// Syntax:
<type> <array_name>[<size>];

// Example:
int numbers[5];  // An array of 5 integers

// You can also initialize the array at the time of declaration:
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Initializing the array with values
```

In this example, `numbers` is an array of integers, and its size is 5.

### 2. **Accessing Array Elements**

Array elements are accessed by using an index. The index is zero-based, meaning the first element is accessed at index 0.

```c
int firstNumber = numbers[0];  // Access the first element (1)
int lastNumber = numbers[4];   // Access the last element (5)
```

You can also modify an array element by accessing it via its index:

```c
numbers[2] = 10;  // Modifies the third element (index 2) to 10
```

## 🔹 **Multi-Dimensional Arrays in C**

In C, arrays can have more than one dimension. While **one-dimensional arrays** are most commonly used, multi-dimensional arrays are useful for storing and working with data that has multiple axes, such as matrices or tables.

### 1. **Two-Dimensional Arrays (2D Arrays)**

A **two-dimensional array** is essentially an array of arrays. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns. Each element in a 2D array is identified by two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

#### **Defining a 2D Array**

You define a two-dimensional array by specifying the number of rows and columns.

```c
int matrix[3][3];  // A 3x3 matrix (3 rows, 3 columns)
```

You can also initialize the array with values:

```c
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

### **Accessing Elements of a 2D Array**

To access an element in a 2D array, you need to specify both the row and the column indices.

```c
int value = matrix[1][2];  // Accesses the element in row 1, column 2 (value is 6)
```

You can modify an element by specifying its row and column index:

```c
matrix[0][0] = 10;  // Modifies the first element in the first row (row 0, column 0)
```

#### **Iterating Over a 2D Array**

To iterate over a 2D array, you can use nested loops:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  // Loop through rows
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {  // Loop through columns
        printf("%d ", matrix[i][j]);  // Print each element
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

### 2. **Three-Dimensional Arrays (3D Arrays)**

A **three-dimensional array** can be thought of as an array of 2D arrays. It is useful for representing data with three axes, such as 3D matrices or grids. 

#### **Defining a 3D Array**

To define a 3D array, you specify three dimensions: the number of layers, rows, and columns.

```c
int cube[3][3][3];  // A 3x3x3 cube (3 layers, 3 rows, 3 columns)
```

You can also initialize a 3D array with values:

```c
int cube[3][3][3] = {
    {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    },
    {
        {10, 11, 12},
        {13, 14, 15},
        {16, 17, 18}
    },
    {
        {19, 20, 21},
        {22, 23, 24},
        {25, 26, 27}
    }
};
```

### **Accessing Elements of a 3D Array**

Accessing elements in a 3D array requires specifying three indices: one for the layer, one for the row, and one for the column.

```c
int value = cube[2][1][1];  // Accesses the element in layer 2, row 1, column 1 (value is 23)
```

You can modify an element by specifying its three indices:

```c
cube[0][0][0] = 100;  // Modifies the first element in the first layer (layer 0, row 0, column 0)
```

#### **Iterating Over a 3D Array**

To iterate over a 3D array, you use three nested loops:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  // Loop through layers
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {  // Loop through rows
        for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {  // Loop through columns
            printf("%d ", cube[i][j][k]);  // Print each element
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

### **Summary of Multi-Dimensional Arrays**

| Array Type | Description                           | Syntax                                | Accessing Elements               |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1D Array   | Single row of elements                | `int arr[5];`                         | `arr[2]` (3rd element)           |
| 2D Array   | Array of arrays (rows and columns)    | `int matrix[3][3];`                   | `matrix[1][2]` (2nd row, 3rd column) |
| 3D Array   | Array of 2D arrays (layers, rows, columns) | `int cube[3][3][3];`                  | `cube[1][2][0]` (2nd layer, 3rd row, 1st column) |


### 4. **Array Limitations**

- The size of an array must be known at compile time, unless dynamic memory allocation (using pointers) is used.
- C arrays do not track their own size, so you must manually ensure you do not access out-of-bounds indices.

## 🔹 **Strings in C**

In C, **strings** are essentially arrays of characters, and they do not have a built-in type for strings. They are represented as a **null-terminated array of characters**.

### 1. **Defining Strings**

Strings are defined in C as arrays of `char`. The size of the array should be at least one more than the number of characters in the string, to account for the **null character** (`'\0'`) that marks the end of a string.

```c
char greeting[] = "Hello, World!";  // String declaration and initialization

// You can also declare a fixed-size array
char name[20] = "Alice";  // A string with fixed size 20
```

### 2. **String Manipulation**

Unlike higher-level languages, C does not provide a built-in string type. Instead, you use functions from the **`string.h`** library to manipulate strings.

#### Common string functions:

- **`strlen()`**: Returns the length of a string, excluding the null terminator.
  ```c
  #include <string.h>
  size_t length = strlen(greeting);  // length is 13
  ```

- **`strcpy()`**: Copies one string to another.
  ```c
  char copy[20];
  strcpy(copy, greeting);  // Copies "Hello, World!" to 'copy'
  ```

- **`strcat()`**: Concatenates (appends) one string to another.
  ```c
  char sentence[40] = "Hello";
  strcat(sentence, ", World!");  // sentence is now "Hello, World!"
  ```

- **`strcmp()`**: Compares two strings lexicographically.
  ```c
  int result = strcmp("apple", "orange");  // Returns a negative value because "apple" < "orange"
  ```

- **`strchr()`**: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
  ```c
  char *ptr = strchr(greeting, 'W');  // Returns pointer to "World!"
  ```

- **`strstr()`**: Finds the first occurrence of a substring.
  ```c
  char *substr = strstr(greeting, "World");  // Returns pointer to "World!" in greeting
  ```

### 3. **String Literals and Character Arrays**

Strings in C are simply arrays of characters, with the last character being a null terminator (`'\0'`). If you are dealing with strings that might change, you should use a **character array**. For string literals (constant strings), you can use pointers to `char`.

```c
const char *str = "This is a string literal.";  // String literal
```

String literals are stored in a special memory section and are **immutable**. It’s best to use `const` with string literals to prevent accidental modification.

### 4. **C String Representation and Memory Management**

Each string in C is an array of characters terminated by the null character (`'\0'`). The null character marks the end of the string, which is why C does not need to store the length of the string explicitly.

### 5. **Pointers and Strings**

In C, strings can also be treated as pointers. For example:

```c
char *greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

The pointer `greeting` points to the first character of the string, and it can be used to access or modify the string's contents. However, when using pointers with string literals, the string is typically stored in **read-only memory**. Attempting to modify a string literal can cause undefined behavior.

---

## 🔹 **String Handling and Common Pitfalls**

### 1. **Null Termination**

In C, **strings are always null-terminated**. If you forget to add the null character (`'\0'`) at the end of a string, you risk accessing undefined memory when working with string functions.

```c
char incompleteString[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};  // Missing '\0'
```

This is dangerous because the string is not properly terminated and functions like `strlen()` will read beyond the end of the array, causing potential crashes or memory corruption.

### 2. **Buffer Overflow**

When copying strings, ensure the destination array is large enough to hold the source string, including the null terminator.

```c
char src[20] = "This is a long string!";
char dest[10];
strcpy(dest, src);  // This will cause a buffer overflow, as dest is too small
```

Use functions like `strncpy()` to avoid buffer overflow, but always ensure proper bounds checking:

```c
strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - 1);
dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';  // Ensuring null termination
```

### 3. **Memory Allocation and Deallocation (Dynamic Strings)**

For dynamically allocated strings, you can use `malloc()` and `free()` from **`stdlib.h`** to manage memory.

```c
char *dynamicString = malloc(50 * sizeof(char));  // Allocate memory for 50 characters

if (dynamicString != NULL) {
    strcpy(dynamicString, "Dynamically allocated string.");
    printf("%s\n", dynamicString);

    free(dynamicString);  // Don't forget to free memory when done
}
```

If you don't free memory after you're done using it, you risk **memory leaks**.
